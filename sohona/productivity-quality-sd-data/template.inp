Title: Sohona PD-Q-SD Template
Data:
  ! The simplest way to run ANY file in MPLUS is to simple place this INP file
  ! in the same folder as your data file and use the relative path (the "./")
  ! to access the file (note the file name has NO spaces to make this work).
DATA: file is ./productivity-quality-sd-data.dat;

VARIABLE:
  ! Cee README.md for documentation on variables
  ! CHANGE AT OWN RISK: you WILL break the DAT file and your analysis
  ! will not be correct (even if MPLUS returns results)

  ! The default for this dataset, close to standard
  Missing are all (-999);

  ! Future research: you can only use one non-numeric flag per MPLUS file
  ! So you can use the period (.), asterisk (*), blank (), here but per the
  ! MPLUS documentation, you should likely recode to missing data to 99.
  ! The reason is FIML is currently a highly recommended approach
  ! (Enders, C. K., 2010, Applied missing data analysis. New York: Guilford Press)
  ! Missing ARE all (99).*;

  Usevariables ARE
    ! Using any combination of varialbles from the "NAMES" above,
    ! define those here for use in your model
  ;

Analysis:
  ! TYPE has different outcomes in the MPLUS output and is complicated
  !   > general = default
  !   > basic = descriptive stats, won't output a model diagram
  !   > complex = standard errors and chi square will be corrected for clustering
  ! See "TYPE": https://www.statmodel.com/HTML_UG/chapter16V8.htm
  ! TYPE IS general;

  ! Default estimator is maximum likelihood (ML), parameter estimates with
  ! conventional standard errors and chi-square test statistic. Other estimators
  ! are available based on use case.
  ! See "ESTIMATOR": https://www.statmodel.com/HTML_UG/chapter16V8.htm
  ! ESTIMATOR IS ML;

  ! Getting "no convergence"? Per MPLUS documentation, try these three lines.
  ! ITERATIONS = 2500;
  ! CONVERGENCE = .00001;
  ! COVERAGE = .000;

  ! Flip on for the Bootstraping
  ! BOOTSTRAP = 5000;

Model:
  ! Add your model here!
  ! Remember, you can also use MPLUS Diagrammer to draw your model and then
  ! paste code here to do other work (e.g., co-vary, mediations, et cetera)

  ! Statement Structure: most MPLUS model commands take this basic form:
  !   Form: variable(s) METHOD variable(s)
  !   Example: jobsat ON rc burnm
  ! Common methods you likely will use:
  !   > ON:    defines regression relationships
  !   > WITH:  defines correlational relationships
  !   > BY:    to name and define the continuous latent variables in the model
  !   > PON:   defines paired regression relationships
  !   > PWITH: defines paired correlational relationships
  !
  ! You will also need value modifiers that have a common approach form of:
  !   Form: variableMODIFIER
  !   Example: rc*
  ! Common modifiers you likely will use:
  !   > *: frees a param at a default value or a specific starting value, e.g. f1*
  !   > @: fixes a param at a default value or a specific value, e.g. f1@0
  !   > (number): constrains params to be equal, e.g. f1 ON x1 (1);

Output:

  ! Additional docs: https://www.statmodel.com/HTML_UG/chapter18V8.htm

  ! modification indices, expected parameter change indices, and two types of
  ! standardized expected parameter change indices for all parameters in the

  MODINDICES

  ! Enable for Bootstrap. Requires:
