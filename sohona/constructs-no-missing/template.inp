Title: Sohana Template
Data:
  ! The simplest way to run ANY file in MPLUS is to simple place this INP file
  ! in the same folder as your data file and use the relative path (the "./")
  ! to access the file (note the file name has NO spaces to make this work).
  File is ./sohana_constructs_no_missing.dat;

Variable:
  ! Cee README.md for documentation on variables
  ! CHANGE AT OWN RISK: you WILL break the DAT file and your analysis
  ! will not be correct (even if MPLUS returns results)
  Names ARE
    id age gender marital people yrsjob
    cusinter yrsfirm educ income category qual
    rel tr pr atn prod out
    bprd jobsat satw satc burnout burnc
    burnm lrn rd wu rc wf
    cr ethc mu lc de uc
    ub ap jc feed part aut;

  ! The default for this dataset (for some unknown reason)
  Missing ARE .;

  ! Future research: you can only use one non-numeric flag per MPLUS file
  ! So you can use the period (.), asterisk (*), blank (), here but per the
  ! MPLUS documentation, you should likely recode to missing data to 99.
  ! The reason is FIML is currently a highly recommended approach
  ! (Enders, C. K., 2010, Applied missing data analysis. New York: Guilford Press)
  ! Missing ARE all (99).*;

  Usevariables ARE
    ! Using any combination of varialbles from the "NAMES" above,
    ! define those here for use in your model
  ;

Analysis:
  ! TYPE has different outcomes in the MPLUS output and is complicated
  !   > general = default
  !   > basic = descriptive stats, won't output a model diagram
  !   > complex = standard errors and chi square will be corrected for clustering
  ! See "TYPE": https://www.statmodel.com/HTML_UG/chapter16V8.htm
  ! TYPE IS general;

  ! Default estimator is maximum likelihood (ML), parameter estimates with
  ! conventional standard errors and chi-square test statistic. Other estimators
  ! are available based on use case.
  ! See "ESTIMATOR": https://www.statmodel.com/HTML_UG/chapter16V8.htm
  ! ESTIMATOR IS ML;

  ! Getting "no convergence"? Per MPLUS documentation, try these three lines.
  !	ITERATIONS = 2500;
  !	CONVERGENCE = .00001;
  !	COVERAGE = .000;

  ! Flip on for the Bootstraping
  ! BOOTSTRAP = 5000;

Model:
  ! Add your model here!
  ! Remember, you can also use MPLUS Diagrammer to draw your model and then
  ! paste code here to do other work (e.g., co-vary, mediations, et cetera)

  ! Statement Structure: most MPLUS model commands take this basic form:
  !   Form: variable(s) METHOD variable(s)
  !   Example: jobsat ON rc burnm
  ! Common methods you likely will use:
  !   > ON:    defines regression relationships
  !   > WITH:  defines correlational relationships
  !   > BY:    to name and define the continuous latent variables in the model
  !   > PON:   defines paired regression relationships
  !   > PWITH: defines paired correlational relationships
  !
  ! You will also need value modifiers that have a common approach form of:
  !   Form: variableMODIFIER
  !   Example: rc*
  ! Common modifiers you likely will use:
  !   > *: frees a param at a default value or a specific starting value, e.g. f1*
  !   > @: fixes a param at a default value or a specific value, e.g. f1@0
  !   > (number): constrains params to be equal, e.g. f1 ON x1 (1);

  ! Let's say you want to build effects into your model. You'll need some added
  ! commands to your model.
  !
  ! MODEL INDIRECT command is used to request indirect and direct effects and
  ! their standard errors and takes the form of:
  !   Form: MODEL INDIRECT: variable(s) METHOD variable(s);
  !   Example: MODEL INDIRECT: jobsat IND rc;
  !
  ! Common methods you likely will use:
  ! > IND: variable on the left-hand side of IND is the dependent variable; the
  !        last variable on the right-hand side of IND is the independent
  !        variable. Variables on the right-hand side of IND are mediating
  !        variables.
  !        Example: MODEL INDIRECT: jobsat IND rc;
  ! > VIA: variable on the left-hand side of IND is the dependent variable; the
  !        last variable on the right-hand side of IND is the independent
  !        variable. Variables on the right-hand side of IND are mediating
  !        variables.
  !        Example: MODEL INDIRECT: jobsat VIA rc;
  !
  ! What's the difference?
  !  > IND: "If there are no mediating variables included in the IND option, all
  !          indirect effects between the independent variable and dependent
  !          variable are computed."
  !  > VIA: "All indirect effects that go from the independent variable to the
  !          dependent variable and include the mediating variables are computed."

Output:
  ! There are lots of options, but the most common are below.

  ! modification indices, expected parameter change indices, and two types of

  ! Enable for Bootstrap. Requires:
  ! > Remove/comment out MODINDICES in OUTPUT
  ! > Enable/remove comment for BOOTSTRAP in ANALYSIS
